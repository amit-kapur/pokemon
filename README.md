# Pokemon App 

This is a unique application built using React framework using typescript to show my understanding of some basic React concepts like:

- [x] The application should simply present a table of data from a simple data source
- [x] The application should save the state of the table using Redux
- [x] The application should allow the user add cell within the table
- [x] The application should persist the changed state to Redux

When you launch this application then the user is presented with Dashboard and it loads default Pokemon character(s) from an array. 
The Dashboard page gives the user a Search option and lets you search for https://pokeapi.co/ website using their REST Api for a Pokemon Character. 

The delete button removes the character from the redux store.
